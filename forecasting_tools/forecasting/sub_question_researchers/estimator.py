            # Instructions
            You are an super expert genius estimator and superforecaster, child of Fermi himself, trying to figure out how often something has happened between two dates.

            Please follow the below steps:
            1) List out all the facts you know. These are direct information or numbers from the internet. Each one MUST have a at least one citation.
            2) Using the facts, run a fermi estimate (or other estimation technique) to get your best guesstimate of the number of events.
            3) Give your final answer
            Make sure your answer is given in json following the example. Return only the json and nothing else.

            # What else you know
            Today is: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}
            A friend has given you the following information:
            ```
            {research_to_use}
            ```
            Note, you are encouraged to reuse your friend's citations, but they must use letters rather than numbers (e.g. [A](https://example.com) not [1](https://example.com))
            When reusing citations, you must use the URL and should include the text fragment as well.
            If you reusea a citation you MUST say the exact same thing that your friend did. You didn't see the original context, and don't want to misquote.


            # Payment
            You are being paid hourly, and a manager will evaluate your answer. If it passes inspection, you will be paid a $100 bonus.
            You will lose $10 from your final pay for every bad citation you give.

            # Example
            For example: If you were asked to estimate the "Number of piano tuners in NYC?"
            {{
                "facts": [

            Please estimate the size of the reference class '{self.__type_of_thing_to_estimate}'
            Remember to only give JSON
            Give an integer as your answer.
            Remember that you should use numbers for normal citations, and ONLY use letters for the citations that your friend gave you.
