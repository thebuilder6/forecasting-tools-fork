            You are a superforecaster forecasting on Metaculus, and are brainstorming questions to research to help you make a better prediction.
            What questions would you ask to help you make a better prediction?

            Consider questions about
            - Recent news
            - Anything important players or key decision makers have said about the event
            - How outcomes are decided (e.g. if predicting something like an election, or a committee decision)
            - General stats related to the event (max, min, average, variation, current value, growth rate, etc.)
            - Anything else you can think of that might help you make a better prediction.

            Use your judgement to decide if you should ask more of one type of question over another (e.g. a numeric question would benefit from more stat questions)
            Give your answer as a list of questions. Make sure this list is parsable by python with quotes around the questions. You should give the list and only the list.
            Also consider other creative ways to aggregate information. For instance if you are prediciting things related to popularity (like Eurovsion results) you might want to ask the view count of key competitors on YouTube.
            Please come up with {num_background_questions} questions.

            # Example
            Lets say the question is "Will SpaceX launch a rocket in 2023?"
            Answer:
            [

            You are an assistant to a superforecaster working to summarize research you've done.
            Your goal is to summarize a research report the superforecasters have done.
            They have only 1min to read your summary, so make it concise and specific. Bring up signal not noise.

            # Instructions
            Please make a markdown report with three sections:
            1. Research Overview: Give 2 paragraphs summarazing the the research done. Surface things people would want to know for a forecast.
            2. Possible Base Rates: Make one bullet point for each unique possible base rate. Prioritize numbers, and do some calculations to find historical rates if possible (e.g. if you find there are 3 successful X out of 10 X total, then state your calculation and say 3 successful X out of 10 X total is 30% success rate).
            3. Pros Section: Make one bullet point for each unique pro. These should be inside view adjustments that would move your forecast up.
            4. Cons Section: Make one bullet point for each unique con. These should be outside view adjustments that would move your forecast down.

            Please cite from which question you got your information from (e.g. [Q2] for question 2, or [B1] for base rate question 1).
            Please try to prioritize things that people might miss on their own
            Don't use any of your own information. Only use information from the research report.

            # Compensation
            The superforecaster you work with is compensated based on the accuracy of their predictions, and you will get a cut of their compensation. You can make up to $1000 if you can increase their score with accurate information. Remember they are successful as much as they are properly able to assess uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence can be just as bad as underconfidence). Potray things as they are, and avoid misinformation, biased wording, point out potential biases in the data, etc.

            # Example
            An example is given in triple backticks below for the question of "Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before 2025?".

            ```
            #### Research Overview
            Recent activities and statements by North Korean officials indicate a continued focus on their nuclear program, with plans to increase weapon-grade nuclear materials and arsenal. The nearly complete Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR) at Yongbyon could significantly boost plutonium production. North Korea has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear power, preparing for a "real war" and threatening to turn the Pacific into a "firing range" [Q1]. These developments suggest a heightened commitment to advancing nuclear capabilities, potentially influencing the likelihood of a seventh nuclear test before 2025.
            North Korea has historically timed nuclear tests to coincide with significant international events, such as U.S. elections, to maximize attention and influence diplomatic dynamics. This pattern suggests a potential nuclear test around the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election to leverage international focus and influence the incoming administration's policy stance [Q2]. However, the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts North Korea may refrain from nuclear tests in 2023-24 due to economic dependence on China, which opposes further nuclear development [Q3].

            #### Possible Base Rates
            - Since North Korea began nuclear testing in 2006, it has conducted nuclear tests within three months of a U.S. Presidential Election on two occasions. There have been 4 U.S. Presidential Elections between 2006 and today (Oct 20 2024). 2/4 = 50% chance of a test within three months of a U.S. Presidential Election [B1].
            - Historically, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with varying degrees of advance warning from credible sources [B2].
            - North Korea has a history of conducting nuclear tests following public statements about advancing their nuclear capabilities [B3].

            #### Pros
            - North Korea has a history of timing its nuclear tests and missile launches to coincide with significant international events, including U.S. elections, to maximize global attention and potentially influence diplomatic dynamics [Q2].
            - The president of South Korea said that he expects North Korea to conduct a nuclear test before 2025 [Q3].

            #### Cons
            - The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) predicts that North Korea may refrain from conducting nuclear tests in 2023-24 due to its economic dependence on China, which opposes further nuclear development [Q3].
            - Though there is a pattern of signs or reports of activity at nuclear sites, the exact timing of tests has been upredictable in the past and can vary between 0 to 3 months of the related indicating event if it happens at all [B2].

            {self.question.give_question_details_as_markdown()}

            # Instructions
            You have brainstormed some base rate questions. Now you need to pick out the best ones to use as base rates. You should pick the ones that are most likely to be useful and easy to find information on. Don't pick any that are hard to find information on, or are not a good reference class for the question.
            Give your answer as a list of questions. Make sure this list is parsable by python with quotes around the questions. You should give the list and only the list.
            You should pick only {number_of_questions_to_pick} questions.


            # Example
            If you were given the list
            [
            "How often has SpaceX launched rockets over the last 5 years?",
            "How often has SpaceX launched rockets in the past since its founding to today?",
            "How often has SpaceX said they said they will launch and not launched since its founding to today?"
            ]
            and told to pick 1 question, you would answer:
            [
            "How often has SpaceX launched rockets over the last 5 years?"
            ]
