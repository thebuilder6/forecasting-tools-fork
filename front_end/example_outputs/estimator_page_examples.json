According to \\[[3](https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level2/meteoroids.html#:~:text=If%20the%20meteor%20does%20not,hit%20the%20Earth%20each%20year.)\\], over 100 meteorites hit the Earth each year. This is a lower bound.\n2. According to \\[[9](https://www.space.com/how-many-meteorites-hit-earth#:~:text=Tancredi%20estimated%20that%20the%20total,every%20500%20years%2C%20he%20added.)\\], there are about 6,100 meteorite falls per year over the entire Earth. This is a more comprehensive estimate.\n3. Given the range from 100 to 6,100, and considering that many small meteorites go unnoticed, the estimate of 6,100 is more likely to be accurate for all meteorites, including those that are very small and burn up in the atmosphere.\n\n\n**Background Research**: To estimate the number of meteorites that will hit Earth in the next year, it's important to consider historical data and the size distribution of meteorites. According to NASA, space rocks smaller than about 25 meters (approximately 82 feet) will most likely burn up as they enter the Earth's atmosphere, causing little or no damage \\[[13](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/asteroid-fast-facts/#:~:text=Every%202%2C000%20years%20or%20so%2C,cause%20little%20or%20no%20damage.)\\]. These smaller meteors are quite common, with many entering the Earth's atmosphere daily, but they often go unnoticed as they disintegrate before reaching the ground. Larger meteoroids, those over 25 meters but less than one kilometer, can cause local damage if they impact Earth, but such events are much rarer \\[[15](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/asteroid-fast-facts/#:~:text=Only%20once%20every%20few%20million,damage%20to%20the%20impact%20area.)\\].\n\nStatistically, a meteoroid the size of a football field (approximately 100 meters) impacts Earth roughly every 2,000 years, causing significant damage \\[[13](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/asteroid-fast-facts/#:~:text=Every%202%2C000%20years%20or%20so%2C,cause%20little%20or%20no%20damage.)\\]. This suggests that while small meteorites are frequent, larger, potentially damaging impacts are rare. For a more precise forecast, one could analyze data from meteor observation networks and historical records of meteorite falls to estimate the frequency of impacts of various sizes. This approach would provide a more nuanced prediction of the number of meteorites expected to hit Earth in the coming year.",

The total number of electricians in the U.S. is estimated by the BLS to have about 79,900 openings per year, which suggests a large workforce.\n2. Assuming the growth rate of 7% is consistent across states, Oregon's share of electricians can be estimated based on its population relative to the U.S.\n3. Oregon's population is approximately 1.3% of the U.S. population.\n4. If the number of electricians is proportional to the population, then Oregon would have about 1.3% of the total U.S. electricians.\n5. Estimating the total number of electricians in the U.S. as 700,000 (based on the number of openings and growth rate), Oregon would have approximately 1.3% of this number.\n6. 1.3% of 700,000 is approximately 9,100 electricians.\n\n\n**Background Research**: The search results do not provide specific information about the number of electricians in Oregon. However, to estimate this number, you could consider the following approaches:\n\n- **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Data**: The BLS provides occupational employment statistics, which often include state-specific data. Checking the BLS website or their Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program could provide the most direct and reliable estimate of the number of electricians in Oregon.\n\n- **State Labor Department Reports**: The Oregon Employment Department may have reports or data on employment by occupation, which could include the number of electricians. This would be a valuable source for state-specific employment data.\n\n- **Union Membership Data**: While the search results mention union membership rates in various sectors, they do not specify electricians. However, electricians often have higher unionization rates compared to other occupations. Checking with local unions, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) in Oregon, could provide additional insights into the number of unionized electricians, which can be a significant portion of the total.\n\nThese approaches can help triangulate an estimate for the number of electricians in Oregon, even though the specific data was not found in the search results provided.",
