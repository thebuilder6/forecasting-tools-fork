Prior to India's achievement, the last new country to join this list was China, which accomplished its first successful soft landing on the Moon in 2013 with the Chang'e 3 mission.\n\nGiven this information, the rate at which new countries have joined the list of those achieving a successful soft landing on the Moon is relatively low. Over the past 60 years, since the first successful soft landing by the Soviet Union in 1966, only four countries have achieved this, averaging approximately one new country every 15 years.\n\n### Numerator\n**Size Found**: 5 | **Hit Definition**: A new country achieves a successful soft landing on the moon\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nI found 6 items that are 'A new country achieves a successful soft landing on the moon'.\nValid instances:\n- Soviet Union -
