    "Demo website: https://mokoresearch.streamlit.app/\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains forecasting and research tools built with Python and Streamlit. The project aims to assist users in making predictions, conducting research, and analyzing data related to hard to answer questions (especially those from Metaculus).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the tools most likely to be useful to you:\n",
    "- 🎯 **Forecasting Bot:** General Forecaster that integrates with the Metaculus AI benchmarking competition. You can forecast with a pre-existing bot or override the class to customize your own (without redoing all the API code, etc)\n",
    "- 📊 **Benchmarking:** Randomly sample quality questions from Metaculus and run you bot against them so you can get an early sense of how your bot is doing by comparing to the community prediction and expected log scores. \n",
    "- 🔍 **Perplexity++ Smart Searcher:** A custom AI-powered internet-informed llm powered by Exa.ai and Gpt. Its a better (but slightly more expensive) alternative to Perplexity.ai that is configurable, more accurate, able to decide on filters, able to link to exact paragraphs, etc.\n",
    "- 🔑 **Key Factor Analysis:** Key Factors Analysis for scoring, ranking, and prioritizing important variables in forecasting questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other cool components and features of the project:\n",
    "- **Base Rate Researcher:** for calculating event probabilities (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Niche List Researcher:** for analyzing very specific lists of past events or items (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Fermi Estimator:** for breaking down numerical estimates (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Metaculus API Wrapper:** for interacting with questions and tournaments\n",
    "- **Monetary Cost Manager:** for tracking AI and API expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/Dtq4JNdXnw) for updates and to give feedback (btw feedback is very appreciated, even just a quick \"I did/didn't decide to use tool X for reason Y, though am busy and don't have time to elaborate\" is helpful to know)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This package is still in an experimental phase. The goal is to keep the package API fairly stable, though no guarantees are given at this phase. There will be special effort to keep the ForecastBot and TemplateBot APIs consistent."

    "### Join the tournament quick-start\n",
    "The quickest way to join the Metaculus Benchmarking Tournament (or any other tournament) is to fork this repo, enable Github workflow/actions, and then set repository secrets. Ideally this takes less than 15min, and then you have a bot in the tournament! Later you can develop locally and then merge in changes to your fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a prewritten workflow that will run the bot every 15min, pick up new questions, and forecast on them. Automation is handled in the `.github/workflows/` folder. The `hourly-run.yaml` file runs the bot every 15 min and will skip questions it has already forecasted on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Fork the repository**: Click 'fork' in the right hand corner of the repo.\n",
    "2) **Set secrets**: Go to `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret` and set API keys/Tokens as secrets. You will want to set your METACULUS_TOKEN. This will be used to post questions to Metaculus, and access the Metaculus OpenAI proxy (you should automatically be given some credits if you have a bot account). For additional environment variables you might want, see the section below.\n",
    "3) **Enable Actions**: Go to 'Actions' then click 'Enable'. Then go to the 'Hourly Run' workflow, and click 'Enable'. To test if the workflow is working, click 'Run workflow', choose the main branch, then click the green 'Run workflow' button. This will check for new questions and forecast only on ones it has not yet successfully forecast on.\n",

    "The bot should just work as is at this point. You can disable the workflow by clicking `Actions > Hourly Run > Triple dots > disable workflow`\n",

    "### Local Development\n",
    "See the 'Local Development' section later in this README.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing the Bot\n",
    "Generally all you have to do to make your own bot is inherit from the TemplateBot and override any combination of the 3 forecasting methods and the 1 research method. This saves you the headache of parsing the outputs, interacting with the Metaculus API, etc. Here is an example. It may also be helpful to look at the TemplateBot code (forecasting_tools/forecasting/forecast_bots/template_bot.py) for a more complete example. If you forked, make sure to change the code in `scripts/run_forecasts_for_ai_tournament` to call your bot to take advantage of the github actions."

If you would rather just use poetry, without the dev container, you can skip to \"Alternatives to Docker\". Otherwise, to get your development environment up and running, you need to have Docker Engine installed and running. Once you do, you can use the VSCode dev container pop-up to automatically set up everything for you.\n",

    " * Mac: [mac-install](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)\n",
    " * Linux: [install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n",
    "    * Do not install Docker Desktop for Linux, rather, select your Linux distribution on the left sidebar and follow the distribution specific instructions for Docker engine. Docker Desktop runs with a different environment in Linux.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the container\n",
    "Once Docker is installed, when you open up the project folder in VSCode, you will see a pop up noting that you have a setup for a dev container, and asking if you would like to open the folder in a container. You will want to click \"open in container\". This will automatically set up everything you need and bring you into the container. If the Docker process times out in the middle of installing python packages you can run the `.devcontiner/postinstall.sh` manually. You may need to have the VSCode Docker extension and/or devcontainer extension downloaded in order for the pop up to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are in the container, poetry should have already installed a virtual environment. For VSCode features to use this environment, you will need to select the correct python interpreter. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then typing `Python: Select Interpreter`. Then select the interpreter that starts with `.venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of vscode extensions are installed automatically (e.g. linting). You may need to wait a little while and then reload the window after all of these extensions are installed. You can install personal vscode extensions in the dev environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Docker\n",
    "There are many ways to manager Docker containers, but generally if you download the vscode Docker extension, you will be able to stop/start/remove all containers and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives to Docker\n",
    "If you choose not to run Docker, you can use poetry to set up a local virtual environment. If you are on Ubuntu, you should be able to just read through and then run `.devcontainer/postinstall.sh`. If you aren't on Ubuntu, check out the links in the postinstall file for where install instructions for dependencies were originally found. You may also want to take a look at VSCode extensions that would be installed (see the list in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file) so that some VSCode workplace settings work out of the box (e.g. automatic Black Formatting).\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Make changes\n",
    "   - Push your changes to your fork\n",
    "   - Make sure you rebase with the upstream main branch before doing a PR (`git fetch upstream` and `git rebase upstream/main`)\n",
    "   - Go to your fork in github, and choose the branch that you have that has your changes\n",
    "   - You should see a 'Contribute' button. Click this and make a pull request.\n",

    "## Development Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Style**\n",
    "   - Code is automatically formatted using Black\n",
    "   - Use type hints for all function parameters and return values\n",
    "   - Use descriptive variable names over comments\n",
    "   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing**\n",
    "   - Add tests where appropriate for new functionality. We aren't shooting for full code coverage, but you shouldn't make none.\n",
